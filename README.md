# Shadowstone

## What is this?
`shadowstone` is a simple tcp proxy server meant to forward calls from a client such as `xmrig` to `emerald`, while at the same time enabling push functionality without having to rewrite the `emerald` server.

## Why not add the changes to Emerald?
At the time of this writing, there are deadlines to be met and adding push functionality to `emerald` would requires a significant change to how things behave. 

## ok cool thanks for the explanation
You're welcome :)
